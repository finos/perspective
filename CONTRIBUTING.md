# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Perspective!

Perspective is built on open source and hosted by the Fintech Open Source
Foundation (FINOS). We invite you to participate in our community by adding and
commenting on [issues](https://github.com/finos/perspective/issues) (e.g., bug
reports; new feature suggestions) or contributing code enhancements through a
pull request.

## Guidelines

When submitting or commenting on an Issue, please respect the following
guidelines. Github Issues are Perspective's project record of bugs and feature
development, e.g. for publishing a release's Changelog, and as such it is
important to keep them informative and on-topic. As such, please understand that
we may remove or reclassify comments or Issues which violate the guidelines.

-   Be respectful and civil!
-   Use the provided Issue templates. If the templates don't fit your need,
    please open a [discussion](https://github.com/finos/perspective/discussions)
    instead.
-   Don't ask for issues to be assigned to you if you're a first-time
    contributor. If you need help picking an issue to work on, please open a
    [discussion](https://github.com/finos/perspective/discussions).
-   Don't add comments asking when a feature will be delivered or a reported
    issue fixed. The Issue will link any in-progress draft PRs or Milestones (if
    known).

When submitting Pull Request (PR), please respect the following coding
guidelines:

-   Complete your
    [FINOS CLA](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/software-projects/easycla/)
    _before_ opening a PR.
-   Please make sure PRs include:

    -   Tests asserting behavior of any new or modified features.
    -   Docs for any new or modified public APIs.
    -   [Benchmarks](https://perspective.finos.org/docs/development/#benchmark)
        for any C++ changes.

-   Keep PRs clean, simple and to-the-point:
    -   Squash "WIP", "Reverting ..", etc., commits.
    -   No merge commits (`git merge master`), prefer `rebase` to resolve
        conflicts with the `master` branch.
    -   Try to organize commits as functional components (as opposed to
        timeline-of-development).

## CLA

Note that commits and pull requests to FINOS repositories such as Perspective
may only be accepted from those contributors with a
[Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://finosfoundation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FINOS/pages/75530375/Contribution+Compliance+Requirements#ContributionComplianceRequirements-ContributorLicenseAgreement)
with FINOS. This may take the form of either:

-   an active, executed Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA) with
    FINOS, OR
-   coverage under an existing, active Corporate Contribution License Agreement
    (CCLA) executed with FINOS (most likely by the developer's employer). Please
    note that some, though not all, CCLAs require individuals/employees to be
    explicitly named on the CCLA.

Commits from individuals not covered under an CLA can not be merged by
Perspective's committers. We encourage you to check that you have a CLA in place
well in advance of making your first pull request.

Need an ICLA? Unsure if you are covered under an existing CCLA? Confused? Email
[help@finos.org](mailto:help@finos.org) and the foundation team will help get it
sorted out for you.

If you have any general questions about contributing to Perspective, please feel
free to open an issue on
[github](https://github.com/finos/perspective/issues/new), or email
[help@finos.org](mailto:finos.org).
