class VirtualSessionModel:
    """
    An interface for implementing a Perspective `VirtualServer`. It operates
    thusly:

    -   A table is selected by name (validated via `get_hosted_tables`).

    -   The UI will ask the model to create a temporary table with the results
        of querying this table with a specific query `config`, a simple struct
        which reflects the UI configurable fields (see `get_features`).

    -   The UI will query slices of the temporary table as it needs them to
        render. This may be a rectangular slice, a whole column or the entire
        set, and it is returned from teh model via a custom push-only
        struct `PerspectiveColumn` for now, though in the future we will support
        e.g. Polars and other arrow-native formats directly.

    -   The UI will delete its own temporary tables via `view_delete` but it is
        ok for them to die intermittently, the UI will recover automatically.
    """

    def get_features(self):
        """
        [OPTIONAL] Toggle UI features through data model support. For example,
        setting `"group_by": False` would hide the "Group By" UI control, as
        well as prevent this field from appearing in `config` dicts later
        provided to `table_make_view`.

        This API defaults to just "columns", e.g. a simple flat datagrid in
        which you can just scroll, select and format columns.

        # Example

        ```python
        return {
            "group_by": True,
            "split_by": True,
            "sort": True,
            "expressions": True,
            "filter_ops": {
                "integer": ["==", "<"],
            },
            "aggregates": {
                "string": ["count"],
                "float": ["count", "sum"],
            },
