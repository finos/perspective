# - Try to find ExprTk lib
#
# This module supports requiring a minimum version, e.g. you can do
#   find_package(ExprTk 2.71828)
# to require version 2.71828 or newer of ExprTk.
#
# Once done this will define
#
#  ExprTk_FOUND - system has eigen lib with correct version
#  ExprTk_INCLUDE_DIRS - the eigen include directory
#  ExprTk_VERSION - eigen version
#
# And the following imported target:
#
#  ExprTk::ExprTk
